# Pulse Check ‚úîÔ∏è

A simple, lightweight, and extensible service for monitoring the health and status of your applications, services, and infrastructure.

## üìù Overview

Pulse Check provides a straightforward way to perform periodic health checks on your critical systems. Whether it's checking an HTTP endpoint, a database connection, or a custom service, Pulse Check can be configured to monitor it and notify you when things go wrong.

The goal is to offer a minimal but powerful tool that is easy to set up, configure, and integrate into any development workflow.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Configurable Health Checks:** Easily define what you want to monitor via a simple configuration file.

- **Multiple Check Types:** Support for common checks like HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, TCP ports, and database connections.

- **Extensible:** Add your own custom check types with a simple plugin architecture.

- **Notifications:** (Coming Soon) Integrated notifications for Slack, email, and webhooks.

- **Simple Status Dashboard:** A clean, minimal UI to view the current status of all monitored services.

- **Lightweight:** Designed to have a small footprint and minimal dependencies.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)

- npm / yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   \`\`\`
   git clone [https://github.com/desmondwong1215/pulse-check.git](https://github.com/desmondwong1215/pulse-check.git)
   cd pulse-check
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies:**

   \`\`\`
   npm install

   # or

   yarn install
   \`\`\`

3. **Configure your checks:**

   - Duplicate the example configuration file:

     \`\`\`
     cp config.example.json config.json
     \`\`\`

   - Modify \`config.json\` to add the services you want to monitor. See the [Configuration](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23-configuration) section below for details.

### Running the Application

- **Start the monitoring service:**

  \`\`\`
  npm start
  \`\`\`

- The service will begin performing checks based on your \`config.json\` file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure the services to monitor by editing the \`config.json\` file. Here is an example structure:

\`\`\`
{
"checks": [
{
"id": "my-api",
"name": "My Production API",
"type": "http",
"interval": "30s",
"target": "[https://api.example.com/health](https://api.example.com/health)"
},
{
"id": "my-database",
"name": "PostgreSQL Database",
"type": "tcp",
"interval": "1m",
"target": "db.example.com:5432"
}
]
}
\`\`\`

- \`id\`: A unique identifier for the check.

- \`name\`: A human-readable name for the service.

- \`type\`: The type of check to perform (\`http\`, \`tcp\`, etc.).

- \`interval\`: How often to perform the check (e.g., \`10s\`, \`5m\`, \`1h\`).

- \`target\`: The endpoint, host, or resource to check.
