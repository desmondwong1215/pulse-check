My current role in Operations Support involves handling real-time logistical issues, troubleshooting terminal operating systems, and coordinating with hauliers and internal teams to manage container flow and vessel schedules. I recently handled a major challenge where a weather delay caused a vehicle booking system backlog; I resolved it by analyzing the bottleneck and coordinating with Yard Planning to open 50 additional ad-hoc slots. This position has honed my skills in crisis management under pressure, cross-functional communication between technical and operational teams, and rapid technical problem-solving. My career goal is to leverage this frontline experience to move into a strategic role, such as Logistics Process Improvement, where I can design long-term solutions to prevent recurring operational bottlenecks.
