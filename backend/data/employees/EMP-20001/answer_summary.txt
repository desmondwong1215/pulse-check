"Samantha Lee exhibits a foundational understanding of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pipelines but currently has limited practical experience in designing and implementing these solutions for complex cloud environments. Her extensive background in cloud architecture, automation, security, and infrastructure design—evident from her leadership role in the Hybrid Cloud Migration initiative and previous automation projects—demonstrates strong technical expertise and project leadership capabilities. While she has shown confidence in managing high-impact cloud projects, her self-assessed beginner level in IaC indicates a potential skill development area to enhance her ability to execute complex infrastructure automation at an advanced level. Strengthening practical IaC skills would further empower her to drive more sophisticated cloud automation and security initiatives, complementing her strategic competencies in stakeholder management and transformation leadership."
