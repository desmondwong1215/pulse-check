  "question": "During the ongoing hybrid cloud migration project, you discover that a recent Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment script contains a potential security misconfiguration that could expose sensitive data. You need to decide how to address this issue before proceeding further. What is the best course of action to ensure security without significantly delaying the project timeline?",
  "options": [
    "Conduct a rapid manual review of the deployment script to identify and patch the security issue immediately, then continue with automated deployments.",
    "Pause the migration temporarily to perform a comprehensive security audit of all IaC scripts, prioritizing the problematic code segments, before resuming deployment.",
    "Implement a real-time monitoring and alert system to detect any security incidents during ongoing deployments, accepting some risk to keep the project on schedule.",
    "Apply the latest security patches manually to the affected systems outside the IaC pipeline, then continue with the automation once verified, balancing security and speed."
